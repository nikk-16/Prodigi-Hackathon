## Our Idea
### <u>THE GLAMAZON</u>

+ Problem Statement

Connected experiences for consumers: How do you ensure that consumers are loyal to brands and will not switch between brands? ​
​
Brenda is a retail store assistant, working for a large cosmetics retailer. She has been noticing that many of her loyal customers who would buy a certain shade of lipstick or eye shadow have been switching to a rival brand which makes similar shades at a lower price. However, she realizes that her brand has much better-quality products, and would like to provide attractive offers to her customers to retain them.<br> 
<br>
She would like to have solutions for: 
<br>
<ol>
i. Digitizing the buying cycle of the consumer through D2C (Direct-to-Consumer)​
<br>
ii. Hyper-personalizing consumer experience using insights into individual preferences ​
<br>
iii. Digital marketing campaigns and loyalty programs
</ol>
