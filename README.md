# Digital Prodigi-Hackathon
Digital ProDigi is an innovation contest that is hosted by Cognizant.

## Our Idea
### <u>THE GLAMAZON</u>

+ Problem Statement

Connected experiences for consumers: How do you ensure that consumers are loyal to brands and will not switch between brands? ​
​
Brenda is a retail store assistant, working for a large cosmetics retailer. She has been noticing that many of her loyal customers who would buy a certain shade of lipstick or eye shadow have been switching to a rival brand which makes similar shades at a lower price. However, she realizes that her brand has much better-quality products, and would like to provide attractive offers to her customers to retain them.<br> 
<br>
She would like to have solutions for: 
<br>
<ol>
i. Digitizing the buying cycle of the consumer through D2C (Direct-to-Consumer)​
<br>
ii. Hyper-personalizing consumer experience using insights into individual preferences ​
<br>
iii. Digital marketing campaigns and loyalty programs
</ol>

## Solution:
Prototype, made with HTML/CSS, Bootstrap, TailwindCSS, JavaScript.

<h2>Why us?</h2>
<p> <li> We are IT enthusiasts who are always learning about new tech stacks, excellent learners, and most importantly, creative thinkers and hard workers. In the event that our proposal is chosen for this round, we will work to scale it up to create a comprehensive response to the issue description.

</li>
<li>The team aspires in putting its knowledge into finding a feasible solution to the problem statements provided to us. Moreover, we participated in the SIH hackathon. Our topic was Satellite Image Dehazing. We worked towards the idea to propose a solution but unfortunately lacked some concepts. Our mentor told us about the mistakes we did and we tried to mend them. We made a note of those mistakes and this time we have tried to overcome them and provide all the necessary information required in the ideation stage. We hope we will get a chance to bring our idea to work.

</li>
<li> Failures teach you more than success. With learning from the past mistakes we made, we have worked very hard for this hackathon and provided solution to one of the problem and got selected in top 20. We were provided another chance to showcase our idea for which we worked and got to complete the proposal and powerpoint answering all the questions those were asked to complete, which we are using full opportunity to come into top 5. This time it is more presentable answering all the question those were missing last time.

<h2> Background work and Research</h2>
<ol>
<li><p> With the emergence of large digitized fine art collections and the successful performance of
deep learning techniques, new research prospects unfold in the intersection of artificial intelligence and art.
In order to explore the applicability of deep learning techniques in understanding art images beyond object
recognition and classification, we employ convolutional neural networks (CNN) to predict scores related to
three subjective aspects of human perception: aesthetic evaluation of the image, sentiment evoked by the
image, and memorability of the image. For each concept, we evaluate several different CNN models trained
on various natural image datasets and select the best performing model based on the qualitative results and
the comparison with existing subjective ratings of artworks. Furthermore, we employ different decision treebased machine learning models to analyze the relative importance of various image features related to the
content, composition, and color in determining image aesthetics, visual sentiment, and memorability scores.
Our findings suggest that content and image lighting have significant influence on aesthetics, in which color
vividness and harmony strongly influence sentiment prediction, while object emphasis has a high impact
on memorability. In addition, we explore the predicted aesthetic, sentiment, and memorability scores in
the context of art history by analyzing their distribution in regard to different artistic styles, genres, artists,
and centuries. The presented approach enables new ways of exploring fine art collections based on highly
subjective aspects of art, as well as represents one step forward toward bridging the gap between traditional
formal analysis and the computational analysis of fine art. </p>

<li><p> Facial beautification induced by plastic surgery, cosmetics or retouching has the ability to
substantially alter the appearance of face images. Such types of beautification can negatively affect the
accuracy of face recognition systems. In this work, a conceptual categorisation of beautification is presented,
relevant scenarios with respect to face recognition are discussed, and related publications are revisited.
Additionally, technical considerations and trade-offs of the surveyed methods are summarized along with
open issues and challenges in the field. This survey is targeted to provide a comprehensive point of reference
for biometric researchers and practitioners working in the field of face recognition, who aim at tackling
challenges caused by facial beautification. </p>

<li><p>Makeup transfer is one of the applications of image style transfer, which refers to transfer the reference makeup to the face without makeup, and maintaining the original appearance of the plain face and the makeup style of the reference face. In order to understand the research status of makeup transfer, this paper systematically sorts out makeup transfer technology. According to the development process of the method of makeup transfer, our paper first introduces and analyzes the traditional methods of makeup transfer. In particular, the methods of makeup transfer based on deep learning framework are summarized, covering both disadvantages and advantages. Finally, some key points in the current challenges and future development direction of makeup transfer technology are discussed. </p>

<li><p> Social commerce is an experiment. It is an attempt by social media platforms to monetise their existing audience even further and bring the window shopping experience to e-commerce. But as we Indians know all too well, converting window shoppers to buyers is a tough task and this trend hasn’t quite caught on. The problem is complex, but several innovative companies are trying to solve the challenges and create a seamless end to end social commerce experience. </p>
