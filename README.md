# Digital Prodigi-Hackathon
Digital ProDigi is an innovation contest that is hosted by Cognizant.

## Our Idea
### <u>THE GLAMAZON</u>

+ Problem Statement

Connected experiences for consumers: How do you ensure that consumers are loyal to brands and will not switch between brands? ​
​
Brenda is a retail store assistant, working for a large cosmetics retailer. She has been noticing that many of her loyal customers who would buy a certain shade of lipstick or eye shadow have been switching to a rival brand which makes similar shades at a lower price. However, she realizes that her brand has much better-quality products, and would like to provide attractive offers to her customers to retain them.<br> 
<br>
She would like to have solutions for: 
<br>
<ol>
i. Digitizing the buying cycle of the consumer through D2C (Direct-to-Consumer)​
<br>
ii. Hyper-personalizing consumer experience using insights into individual preferences ​
<br>
iii. Digital marketing campaigns and loyalty programs
</ol>

## Solution:
Prototype, made with HTML/CSS, Bootstrap, TailwindCSS, JavaScript.

<h2>Why us?</h2>
<p> <li> We are IT enthusiasts who are always learning about new tech stacks, excellent learners, and most importantly, creative thinkers and hard workers. In the event that our proposal is chosen for this round, we will work to scale it up to create a comprehensive response to the issue description.

</li>
<li>The team aspires in putting its knowledge into finding a feasible solution to the problem statements provided to us. Moreover, we participated in the SIH hackathon. Our topic was Satellite Image Dehazing. We worked towards the idea to propose a solution but unfortunately lacked some concepts. Our mentor told us about the mistakes we did and we tried to mend them. We made a note of those mistakes and this time we have tried to overcome them and provide all the necessary information required in the ideation stage. We hope we will get a chance to bring our idea to work.

</li>
<li> Failures teach you more than success. With learning from the past mistakes we made, we have worked very hard for this hackathon and provided solution to one of the problem and got selected in top 20. We were provided another chance to showcase our idea for which we worked and got to complete the proposal and powerpoint answering all the questions those were asked to complete, which we are using full opportunity to come into top 5. This time it is more presentable answering all the question those were missing last time.
